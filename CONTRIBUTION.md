- Each brach should include a single purpose instead of multiple purposes
- Acceptable prefixes are:
  - `feature/`: Adding a new feature to project
  - `bug/`: Perform a bug fix for given certain issue
  - `hotfix/`: Temporary fix and which should be revamp in the future
  - `devops/`: DevOps related PRs, this PR shouldn't do any change to the source code
  - `misc/`: lint fix, format...the thing that isn't important enough

2. **Code Contributions:** Orochi Network uses naming conventions and prefers merging when incorporating changes.

3. **Commit Messages:** Write clear and concise commit messages that describe your changes and reference any relevant issues (e.g., "Use higher gas fees for speeding up transactions (#11936)").
